## Story
In 2020 i was programming on Python. And i've thought: "Hmm, why not create a GUI for pip? That'd be very cool!", and started developing. As i remember, it weren't released. In October/September 2022, i had no idea on what to create. But i remembered the failed project with pip, and got a wish to develop and extend it. Now, instead of an ugly, 2 commands program i am developing a big tool, which supports Python, Node and many other.
